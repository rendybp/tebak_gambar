Welcome to my silly little spelling game!

The game is pretty simply really:

1. An image is displayed.
2. Beneath the image are lines to indicate how many letters are in the word.
3. The player/user types letters to spell what they see.


Where the words come from:

The words to be spelled are the first portion of the image file names.

ie: A file named kite.png will produce the word 'kite' to be spelled.
